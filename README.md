There are 2 scripts created here so far:

1. CreateAuth.py:
   The purpose of this script is to generate the access token that's used as a Bearer token for subsequent requests towards the umbrella deployment.

2. CreateNetwork.py:
   This uses the access token from CreateAuth to create the network identity using the network data provided in the payload of the requst.

3. req_data_file.py contains the API keys information and the payload data.
